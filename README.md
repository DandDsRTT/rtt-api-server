# The RTT API server

This bare-bones API server is part of a proof-of-concept showing that `APIFunction`s `CloudDeploy`ed on Wolfram Cloud can be hit via code based on their `EmbedCode`. The server is running on Render [here](https://rtt-api-server.onrender.com), and is hit by a bare-bones [web app](https://www.github.com/DandDsRTT/rtt-app) which is running as a GitHub Page [here](https://DandDsRTT.github.io).
